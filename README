         QEMU README
         ===========

QEMU is a generic and open source machine & userspace emulator and
virtualizer.

QEMU is capable of emulating a complete machine in software without any
need for hardware virtualization support. By using dynamic translation,
it achieves very good performance. QEMU can also integrate with the Xen
and KVM hypervisors to provide emulated hardware while allowing the
hypervisor to manage the CPU. With hypervisor support, QEMU can achieve
near native performance for CPUs. When QEMU emulates CPUs directly it is
capable of running operating systems made for one machine (e.g. an ARMv7
board) on a different machine (e.g. an x86_64 PC board).

QEMU is also capable of providing userspace API virtualization for Linux
and BSD kernel interfaces. This allows binaries compiled against one
architecture ABI (e.g. the Linux PPC64 ABI) to be run on a host using a
different architecture ABI (e.g. the Linux x86_64 ABI). This does not
involve any hardware emulation, simply CPU and syscall emulation.

QEMU aims to fit into a variety of use cases. It can be invoked directly
by users wishing to have full control over its behaviour and settings.
It also aims to facilitate integration into higher level management
layers, by providing a stable command line interface and monitor API.
It is commonly invoked indirectly via the libvirt library when using
open source applications such as oVirt, OpenStack and virt-manager.

QEMU as a whole is released under the GNU General Public License,
version 2. For full licensing details, consult the LICENSE file.


Building
========

QEMU is multi-platform software intended to be buildable on all modern
Linux platforms, OS-X, Win32 (via the Mingw64 toolchain) and a variety
of other UNIX targets. The simple steps to build QEMU are:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  ../configure
  make

Additional information can also be found online via the QEMU website:

  http://qemu-project.org/Hosts/Linux
  http://qemu-project.org/Hosts/W32


Submitting patches
==================

The QEMU source code is maintained under the GIT version control system.

   git clone git://git.qemu-project.org/qemu.git

When submitting patches, the preferred approach is to use 'git
format-patch' and/or 'git send-email' to format & send the mail to the
qemu-devel@nongnu.org mailing list. All patches submitted must contain
a 'Signed-off-by' line from the author. Patches should follow the
guidelines set out in the HACKING and CODING_STYLE files.

Additional information on submitting patches can be found online via
the QEMU website

  http://qemu-project.org/Contribute/SubmitAPatch
  http://qemu-project.org/Contribute/TrivialPatches


Bug reporting
=============

The QEMU project uses Launchpad as its primary upstream bug tracker. Bugs
found when running code built from QEMU git or upstream released sources
should be reported via:

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/

If using QEMU via an operating system vendor pre-built binary package, it
is preferable to report bugs to the vendor's own bug tracker first. If
the bug is also known to affect latest upstream code, it can also be
reported via launchpad.

For additional information on bug reporting consult:

  http://qemu-project.org/Contribute/ReportABug


Contact
=======

The QEMU community can be contacted in a number of ways, with the two
main methods being email and IRC

 - qemu-devel@nongnu.org
   http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/qemu-devel
 - #qemu on irc.oftc.net

Information on additional methods of contacting the community can be
found online via the QEMU website:

Distributed Qemu
================
Steps to boot a distributed qemu: 
I. Modify some code (for simplicity, we hard code something) and compile 
distributed qemu code. (https://github.com/binss/QEMU.git)
II. Create QEMU image
III. Compile a linux kernel (Optional)
IV. Run Qemu!

I. Compile distributed qemu code
    Get the source: 
        $: git clone https://github.com/binss/QEMU.git
        $: cd QEMU
    Change the shared file pathname and default port: 
        Edit $QEMU_DIR/interrupt-router.c and change macro definition of 
        ROUTER_SOCKET_PREFIX and ROUTER_TCP_DEFAULT_PORT to appropriate values. 
    Compile it: 
        $: $QEMU_DIR/configure --target-list=x86_64-softmmu --enable-kvm
        $: make
II. Create QEMU image (These operations should be executed with graphic display)
    Create a raw disk image (format=qcow2, capacity=10G): 
        $: $QEMU_DIR/qemu-img create -f qcow2 ubuntu-server.img 10G
    Install OS from CD-ROM image (memory=1024MB, os 
    image=ubuntu-14.04.3-server-amd64.iso) 
        $: $QEMU_DIR/qemu-system-x86_64 -m 1024 ubuntu-server.img -cdrom 
        ubuntu-14.04.3-server-amd64.iso -enable-kvm
    Boot OS (This is the standalone qemu): 
        $: $QEMU_DIR/qemu-system-x86_64 -m 1024 ubuntu-server.img -enable-kvm
III. Compile a linux kernel (Optional)
    Get the source: 
        $: git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
        $: cd linux
    Compile it: 
        $: make menuconfig (maybe deselect some useless hardware drivers)
        $: make 
IV. Run Qemu!
    In the current implementation BSP and AP can boot in any order. 
    Set the ACL (Thus you don't need to use sudo to run KVM. It will be 
    reset after reboot): 
        $: sudo setfacl -m "u:[username]:rw" /dev/kvm
    Boot BSP (Use -kernel to indicates linux image, -hda to indicates disk 
    image, 'console=ttyS0' tells guest to redirect serial port to qemu serial 
    port, '-cpu host' tells qemu to generate the same cpu model as host, 
    '-machine kernel-irqchip=off' tells qemu to simulate irqchip (APIC and 
    IOAPIC) in qemu rather than KVM, '-smp 2' tell qemu to generate 2 vcpus, 
    '-m 512' indicate 512 MB memory, '-local-cpu 1,start=0' indicates there 
    is 1 local cpu, the index starts from 0, '-net user -net nic,model=virtio' 
    tells qemu to generate a virtio-based NIC, '-monitor 
    telnet:127.0.0.1:1234,server,nowait' enable telnet to qemu monitor by 
    port 1234): 
        $: $QEMU_DIR/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 --nographic -kernel 
        $LINUX_BUILD_DIR/arch/x86/boot/bzImage -hda ubuntu-server.img 
        -append "root=/dev/sda1 console=ttyS0" -cpu host -machine kernel-irqchip=off 
        -smp 2 -m 512  --enable-kvm -serial mon:stdio -shm-path 
        [a user-defined name] -local-cpu 1,start=0 -net user -net nic,model=virtio 
        -monitor telnet:127.0.0.1:1234,server,nowait
    Boot AP (Note the difference between BSP and AP, '-local-cpu 1,start=1'): 
        $: $QEMU_DIR/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 --nographic -kernel 
        $LINUX_BUILD_DIR/arch/x86/boot/bzImage -hda ubuntu-server.img 
        -append "root=/dev/sda1 console=ttyS0" -cpu host -machine 
        kernel-irqchip=off -smp 2 -m 512  --enable-kvm -serial mon:stdio 
        -shm-path [a user-defined name, should be the same as BSP] -local-cpu 
        1,start=1 -net nic,model=virtio -monitor telnet:127.0.0.1:1235,server,nowait

-- End
